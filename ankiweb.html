- this add-on allows to hide/unhide the table or editor view in the browser and quickly change between them. 
- When you maximize the editor the table that holds the search results will be adjusted so that it has only one card per note: This makes sure that whenever you press "Ctrl+n"/"Ctrl+p" you will see something different. Otherwise for note types that have multiple cards the view wouldn't change as long as you go through cards of the same note. This relies on a function that was introduced to the add-on "Advanced Browser" in 2018. If you use 2.1 you need to have <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/874215009" rel="nofollow">Advanced Browser</a>. This feature is not available in the Advanced Browser version for 2.0 since this is no longer updated for 2.0. I uploaded a patched version of Advanced Browser for 2.0 that contains this one patch <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1373322197" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Alternatively you can use <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/594622823" rel="nofollow">Sticky Searches</a>.
- shortcuts can be configured in Anki 2.1 in the add-on dialog. In Anki 2.0 you need to adjust the json file in the add-on folder.
- the default keybindings are:
    "hotkey_toggle": "Alt+D", 
    "hotkey_editor_only":"Alt+3", 
    "hotkey_table_only":"Alt+4",
    "hotkey_toggle_sidebar":"Alt+5", 
    "hotkey_back_to_default":"Alt+6",
- the setting "splitter_bigger" should slightly increase the size of the splitter between the table and editor so that it's easier to click with the mouse. This doesn't work on 2.0.
- feedback, error reports, improvements are very welcome. Ideally at <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__browser_MaximizeHide_TableEditor/issues" rel="nofollow">github where I can answer better</a>.
- use this at your own risk.
- This add-ons reuses some code by glutanimate and Arthur Milchior.
