This add-on allows to hide/unhide the table or editor view in the browser and quickly change between them.

You can also download the screencast (gif) by right-clicking it. Then select "save image as" from the context menu (tested in Chrome and Firefox). Then open this gif with a program that supports slowing down gifs. On Windows I use the popular image viewer IrfanView that can also display gifs. IrfanView has "Options-&gt;Start/Stop Animation" and you can adjust the speed with [SHIFT][CTRL][+] or [SHIFT][CTRL][-]. On Linux I use mpv. 

When you maximize the editor the table that holds the search results will be adjusted so that it has only one card per note: This makes sure that whenever you press "Ctrl+n"/"Ctrl+p" you will see something different. Otherwise for note types that have multiple cards the view wouldn't change as long as you go through cards of the same note. You need to have <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/874215009" rel="nofollow">Advanced Browser</a>.

Use this at your own risk. This add-ons reuses some code by glutanimate and Arthur Milchior.

<b># Config</b>
shortcuts can be configured in Anki 2.1 in the add-on dialog.
The default keybindings are:
    "hotkey_toggle": "Alt+D", 
    "hotkey_editor_only":"Alt+3", 
    "hotkey_table_only":"Alt+4",
    "hotkey_toggle_sidebar":"Alt+5", 
    "hotkey_back_to_default":"Alt+6",
The setting "splitter_bigger" should slightly increase the size of the splitter between the table and editor so that it's easier to click with the mouse.

<b># bugs</b>
Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times). If you find a bug let me know on <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__browser_MaximizeHide_TableEditor/issues" rel="nofollow">github</a> or via reddit (/u/ijgnord).
